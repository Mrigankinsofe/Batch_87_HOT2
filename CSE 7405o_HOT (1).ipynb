    "# Introduction\n",
    "Being able to predict Bankruptcy of a company well in advance is of great importance to the various stakeholders of the company and also help in economic decision making. The purpose of our research is to study the suitability of major bankruptcy prediction models by applying them to the dataset provided to us. Our attempts of bankruptcy prediction are based on various Machine Learning Models such as Decision Trees, Bagging, Random Forest, AdaBoost, XGboost etc. This report is an empirical study of bankruptcy prediction based on data set provided to us, mainly focusing on tackling imbalance and the comparison of different methods.\n",
